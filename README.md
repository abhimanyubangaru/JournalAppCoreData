# JournalAppCoreData
After learning more, trying to use Swiftui Core Data MVVM to create a journal application. 

I used Xcode 13.4 to create this project, and it should run on iOS 14+. I stored all the entry information using CoreData. I haven't really used any additional dependancies besides apple's own packages, so the build should be pretty simple. 

Build Instructions: 
  1. Clone the repo onto device. 
  2. Click on the .xcodeproj file. 
  3. Open Xcode and at the top of the IDE, change the target to any simulator(or device of choice). 
  4. Click the run button -- looks like a play button on a TV remote -- to run.
